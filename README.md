Statistics With R
=================

This repository contains materials for a course led in FMI about analysing and
manipulating data with the R programming language.

The course follows a book written by one hell of a professor called Verzani - [Simple R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf). (He *is* really awesome.)

Course Organization
===================

In the imaginatively named file `agenda.txt` you'll find the course curriculum.

In each folder titled `nn-<lecture>` you'll find materials for the corresponding
lecture. Of course, you may also not try to find them, which could lead to a
certain abdominal discomfort in a more sensitive individual.

This README has the immaculant task of providing any other useful info. Please
handle it with care and love as it gets rather lonely hanging by yourself on a
cold server, somewhere in Canada.

written quite well and it's free! Enjoy it :)
